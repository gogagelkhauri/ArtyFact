        I’ve always been interested in art.Gaining knowledge about new artists, collecting their works and so on. I believe that within all of us, is a desire to create one way or another, we enjoy being in the surroundings of beautiful things. Since joining Artifact, it has become so much easier for me to browse and support popular as well as new artists. It gives me the ability to acquire information of many different artforms with just a few clicks, as well as gain information about the artist's views, inspiration and so on.

        I’ve known I wanted to create beautiful paintings since the age of 10. Bringing your views and feelings onto a canvas is a process so dear to my heart, it can’t be put into words. However, as a creative person, it is often difficult to be your own work manager at the same time. I was having a hard time trying to promote my paintings to the world and make a living out of it. Artifact has brought nothing but comfort to my creative process. It gave me and many other artists a platform where you can trust the site and just keep focusing on your craft. This completely changed my work ethic for the better. Artifact brought me back to creating art, rather than stressing about how I show it to others.
